# Data visualization app

3 Page application With login module and authentication

- 3 screens/pages to show different chart types using any charting library (any number of charts/tables/any data visualisation)
- 1-2 charts which consume data from service directly
- 2-3 charts which consume data after processing(sorting, re-structuring, etc.) on front-end
- Secure (token-based, session-based etc.) back-end APIs for all the requests
- Maintain state of filters/queries/transfer data across screens
- Atleast 1 Aggregate query in DB
- Asset bundling, versioning and minification
- 1 scheduled job to transform data (atleast 10K random records) and store it back in DB/json/CSV
- 1 back-end API to read file from filesystem and modify the contents through streams and produce data
- Make connection to multiple DBs and collections/tables and fetch data
- Session management, auto destroy data on logout
- Unit tests
- Optimisation of application, front-end + back-end, API calls

Notes:
- Technology and Framework: Angular for UI, Node and Express for Backend, Mongo DB for Database
- Random data-set
- Docker Image as final output
- Comment on logical code blocks

Points to be assessed upon:
- UI design
- Overall UX
- Architecture
- Overall application speed
- Code commenting
- Task completion
